## Hey there!!!

My name is dad bot, I am a discord bot. You can invite me to your server by <a href="https://lnkd.in/gQ5YDjz"> clicking here </a>.
My purpose is to keep bad words out of the server and to motivate you when you're feeling low. I scold and punish the people who uses bad words.

## Commands

You can write `motivate me daddy` to get some motivational quotes. <br>
I'm also triggered if you write hindi cuss words in the chat (it's better if I'm not triggered by this) <br>
More commands will be added soon.

## Installation

`git clone` <br>
`cd dad-bot` <br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>

After you've done this, you'll need to create a token and place it in a `.env` file as `TOKEN = "YOUR TOKEN HERE"` without the quotes.
To generate the token head over to <a href ="https://discord.com/developers/applications"> Discord Developers </a> and create an application.

## Contribution
Issues and PRs are always welcome.

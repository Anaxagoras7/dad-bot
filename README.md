## Hey there!!!

I'm Dad Bot, and I'm a Discord bot. By <a href="https://lnkd.in/gQ5YDjz"> clicking here </a>., you may invite me to your server. My goal is to prevent negative language off the server and to inspire you when you're down. I chastise and penalise those who use foul language. 

![DAD BOT (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53416067/135572057-ea09df92-e28e-4b13-888a-e8c8501bd52d.jpg)



## Commands

You can write `motivate me daddy` to get some motivational quotes. <br>

You can write `make me laugh daddy` to get some funny jokes.<br>
I'm also triggered if you write hindi cuss words in the chat (it's better if I'm not triggered by this or else it's bye bye time for you) <br>

More commands will be added soon.

## Installation

`git clone` <br>
`cd dad-bot` <br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>

After you've done this, you'll need to create a token and place it in a `.env` file as `TOKEN = "YOUR TOKEN HERE"` without the quotes.
To generate the token head over to <a href ="https://discord.com/developers/applications"> Discord Developers </a> and create an application.
